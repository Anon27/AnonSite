              <p>
                Micro Needling (or collagen induction therapy) - also known as Skin Needling - is the latest skin renewal technique to
                restore the healthy youthful appearance of the skin which results in an almost side effect free concept for facial and
                non facial skin rejuvenation.<br/>
                <br/>
                The results of Micro Needling are similar to those obtained with other similar technologies. The procedure creates a multitude of
                tiny puncture wounds to the dermis which includes the release of growth factors that stimulate the production of new collagen and elastin,
                thus creating dermal damage without removal of the healthy epidermis. Unlike other resurfacing techniques, this speeds up the healing process
                rapidly, and does not cause any comparable pain. As a result, you enjoy quick results that will last.
              </p>
              <p id="where">
              <h3>Typical areas that are treated</h3>
              Micro Needling is a novel way to treat: fine lines and wrinkles around eyes, mouth, cheeks, neck and décolleté.
              Other areas of the body can also be treated such as the abdomen, back of the hands and arms. All forms of acne scars, most surgical
              scars including facelift scars, abdominal scars, breast plastic operation, post liposuction scars, orthopaedic scars, stretch marks
              and burn contracture scars can safely be treated. In addition chicken pox scars can also be treated.<br/>
              <br/>
              The typical areas treated are for full face for skin rejuvenation and skin radiance, skin firmness and compactness as well as rough
              and uneven skin texture. Hyper-pigmentation can also be treated.<br/>
              <br/>
              Micro Needling does not have a positive effect on any active inflammatory condition including active acne.
              </p>
              <p id="how">
              <h3>How does Micro Needling work?</h3>
              The concept of Micro Needling is based on the skins natural ability to repair itself whenever it encounters physical damage such as cuts,
              burns and other abrasions. Immediately after an injury occurs to the skin our body reuses the damaged collagen and elastin fibres as well
              as other damaged skin components to produce new ones.<br/>
              <br/>
              A pinprick injury from a microneedle goes through the same 3 stages of the healing process as a larger wound:<br/>
              1.Inflammation <br/>
              2.Proliferation (tissue formation) <br/>
              3.Tissue Remodelling <br/>
              <br/>
              Micro needling allows for controlled induction of the skins self repair mechanism by creating micro “injuries” in the skin which
              triggers new collagen synthesis, yet does not pose the risk of permanent scarring. The result is smoother, firmer and younger looking skin.<br/>
              <br/>
              Micro needling, with the Titanium Dermaroller, results in the formation of thousands of miniscule pin prick wounds in the targeted
              skin tissue. Each of those pin prick wounds is an onset of the normal healing process occurring in the broken skin and leads
              to new collagen being laid down in the upper dermal layer of the skin. Consecutive Micro Needling sessions produce new
              collagen progressively until indented scars and deep lines are fitted.
              </p>
              <p id="when">
              <h3>When should one start Micro Needling?</h3>
              Human skin is a living organ which performs dynamic activities such as growth,
              repair and maintenance. Our skin requires cytokines and growth factors as key modulators of skin cell metabolism
              and their levels decreases with the aging process which results in slow cell renewal and defective skin defence systems.
              Micro Needling stimulates the production of endogenous cytokines and growth factors which improves skin elasticity and plasticity
              via accelerated rejuvenating process.<br/>
              <br/>
              Micro Needling should be started sooner when the skin has a much greater ability to rejuvenate. If wrinkles are left and they
              become ingrained and scar like they are much more difficult to treat. Loss of collagen in the face causes the dreaded sagging.
              </p>
              <p id="after">
              <h3>What to expect after a Micro Needling procedure?</h3>
              These minute injuries cause micro-bleeding that is not visible on the skin. The needle only penetrates through the
              epidermis and does not remove it thus the skin natural protective barrier remains intact. The pierced epidermis rapidly
              heals in a matter of hours. After the procedure, the treated skin has the appearance of moderate sunburn which improves
              over the next 24 to 48 hours. Make up can be worn the following day.<br/>
              <br/>
              The results are not instantaneous as it takes at least 100 days for collagen to be manufactured by the body once the
              treatment has been performed. Treatment effects are cumulative and a softening of fine lines and wrinkles will usually
              be seen within 6-8 weeks of each treatment.
              </p>
              <p id="advantages">
              <h3>Advantages over other treatments:</h3>
              • No skin damage as epidermis left intact <br/>
              • No skin sensitivity to UV light <br/>
              • No risk of permanent skin discolouration <br/>
              • Procedure suitable for all skin types as well as thin skin <br/>
              • Short healing time <br/>
              • Minimal down time of between 24 – 48 hours <br/>
              • Minimal discomfort post treatment <br/>
              • Cost effective in alternative to ablative procedures <br/>
              • Generally painless (topical anaesthetic can be used) <br/>
              • Minimal or no side effects <br/>
              </p>
              <p id="combine">
              <h3>Can this be combined with other procedures?</h3>
              Micro Needling can be combined at a later stage with other non invasive procedures such as laser, Botox, fillers, superficial peels,
              transdermal mesotherapy, and other non ablative laser procedures. These other procedures usually address different problems of ageing such
              as dull complexion, pigmentation, sagging of jowls, forehead and flabby necks. Combined procedures usually give superior results. Up to
              300% greater absorption of active ingredients can be achieved following a Micro Needling treatment.
              </p>
              <p id="safety">
