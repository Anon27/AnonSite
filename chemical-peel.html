                Chemical skin peeling is a highly versatile and adaptable skin treatment in a variety of depths and strengths to treat a wide range of skin
                conditions. It can be used effectively as a treatment on its own or it can be used to compliment a number of other procedures such as Laser,
                Skin Needling, Microdemabrasion and Radio Frequency. A chemical peel is used to exfoliate damaged surface skin while stimulating the growth of
                healthier skin.
                <br/>
                A chemical peel involves the application of a chemical that destroys skin cells. Many different chemicals can be used, but they all destroy skin
                cells. Chemical peels can be classified by how many cells are destroyed, i.e. the depth of the chemical peel.
              </p>
              <p id="indications">
              <h3>Indications for a Chemical Peel:</h3>
              • Skin ageing – laxity, loss of dermal support and loss of volume <br/>
              • Lines and wrinkles <br/>
              • Hyper-pigmentation or irregular skin tone <br/>
              • Acne <br/>
              • Acne scarring <br/>
              • Rosacea <br/>
              • Open pores and coarse textured skin <br/>
              • General smoothing and refinement of the skin <br/>
              • Congestion and sluggishness <br/>
              </p>
              <p id="benefits">
              <h3>Benefits of Chemical Peel:</h3>
              • Removal of superficial dead skin cells to aid natural desquamation <br/>
              • To instigate an inflammatory reaction causing the renewal of keratinocyte cells <br/>
              • To impact a wounding response to stimulate the Fibroblast cells to produce new collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid <br/>
              • Break down clusters of melanin pigment to treat hyper-pigmentation <br/>
              • Deep cleanse and purify the skin by removal of congestion in the pilo-sebaceous duct <br/>
              • General smoothing and refinement of the skin <br/>
              • Rebuild tissue in atrophic scarring <br/>
              • Tighten and firm the skin <br/>
              • Smooth lines and wrinkles <br/>
              • Reduce inflammation and restore barrier function of the skin <br/>
              • Hydration <br/>
              </p>
              <p id="agents">
              <h3>Chemical skin peeling agents:</h3>
              Peel solutions most typically contain alpha hydroxy acids (glycolic acid), beta hydroxy acid (salicylic acid), tricholoracetic acid (TCA), or phenol
              as the exfoliating agent. Each of these is categorized by the concentration and the resulting depth of the peel on the skin which can range from
              superficial (also known as micro or light peels) to medium or deep peels. <br/>
              <br/>
              Results are closely linked to the depth of peel performed. Superficial peels (typically those using low concentrations of AHA or BHA) offer far less
              dramatic improvement than medium or deep peels (usually TCA or phenol-based) do. Overall, you can expect minor to major improvement in fine lines and
              wrinkles, skin discolouration, skin texture, rebuilding of collagen, removal of blackheads, and a temporary reduction in excessive oil production.
              On the other hand, chemical peels in any form cannot remove or reduce the appearance of blood vessels on the skin, they cannot change the appearance
              of enlarged pores, they do not have an effect on keloidal scarring, they do not work as a facelift, and they have limited benefit for improving skin
              discoloration for those with darker skin colour. <br/>
              </p>
              <p id="risks">
              <h3>Risk of chemical peels:</h3>
              Superficial peels have few associated risks but also offer less noticeable results. Some redness, swelling, and increased skin sensitivity can occur
              with superficial peels. When significant results are desired, complications increase proportionately. <br/>
              Medium and deep peel complications can include scarring, infection, temporary or permanent changes in skin colour (this is especially true for deeper
              peels), and cold sore breakouts for those with a history of cold sores.
              <br/>
              Chemical peels are performed by the application of the specific solution that actually dissolves the skin’s top layers, either over the entire face or
              on specific areas. Often, several shallow to medium-depth peels can achieve similar results to one deep-peel treatment, with less post-procedure risk
              and a shorter recovery time. <br/>
              <br/>
              • Alpha hydroxy acid peels (AHA) use glycolic, malic, citric, mandelic and lactic acid as the peeling ingredient and these are considered
              superficial to medium peels depending on the concentration used. Typically the concentrations range from 20% to 70%. AHA peels are effective in
              the production of new collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid which is stimulated in the dermis whilst the epidermis cell turnover is increased to
              improve barrier function and hydration levels of the skin.<br/>
              Improvement and prevention of scarring is achieved, and clusters of post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation can be broken down. In addition, AHAS are
              well known to have a humectant effect, whereby they are able to draw and retain water within the skin thus benefitting the skin in terms of hydration
              and correct function. Repeated treatments are necessary for all concentrations to maintain results. <br/>
              <br/>
              • Beta hydroxy acid (BHA) or salicylic acid peels are not as popular as AHA peels as they are less aggressive and less sensitising, yet they can
              be equally effective and have specific advantages for some skin types. A salicylic acid solution is a larger molecule structure than AHAS but can
              work in a way that is similar to a glycolic acid peel. Here, irritation may be reduced. Salicylic acid is a compound closely related to aspirin
              (acetylsalicylic acid), and it retains its aspirin-like anti-inflammatory properties. A deep BHA peel can be superior for many skin types, because
              the irritation and inflammation are kept to a minimum due to the analgesic action of the BHA compound. Salicylic acid is also lipid soluble;
              therefore, it is a good peeling agent for blemish-prone skin with blackheads, and therefore very effective in treating acne skin. The most common
              concentrations used today are 10% to 30%. <br/>
              <br/>
              • Other peeling agents include Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), Resourcinol, the Jessner's peel and Phenols, which are used for medium to deep medical
              grade peels effective on severely photo damaged or scarring skins, and for the deeper regeneration of tissue.TCA peels is an analogue for acetic acid
              and are usually in strengths of 20% – 30%, with a history of being effective and safe. It can be used for peeling the face, neck, hands, and other
              areas of the body. It has a lesser bleaching effect than phenol, and is excellent for "spot" peeling of specific areas. TCA peels are best for fine
              lines, and are suitable for treating acne scarring.<br/>
              Jessner’s peel is a medium peel containing 14% salicylic acid, 14% lactic acid, and 14% resorcinol. This peel is an excellent peel for acne as it
              effectively breaks down the intercellular adhesions and thereby reducing hyperkeratosis. <br/>
