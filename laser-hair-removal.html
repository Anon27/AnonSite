                <h3>The Comfortable Way to Eliminate Unwanted Body Hair</h3>
              </header>
              <p>
                A revolution is underway, for body hair removal that
                is virtually painless. The <b><i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free™</i></b> treatment,
                offered by The Beauty Doctors, can now free you from daily shaving, painful
                plucking and expensive waxing to give you silky smooth and beautifully bare
                skin.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free</i> is the next-generation of laser hair removal. It's
                an effective and permanent hair reduction solution that is simple and easy.
                It takes cutting-edge medical laser technology and combines it with the
                comfort and convenience of a trip to the spa. In fact, <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free</i>
                uses new breakthrough technology that has
                been described as one of the most comfortable laser hair removal options
                available.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any medical laser procedure can be a bit intimidating at first. <em>Learn more about
                <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free™</i> here, so you'll feel completely comfortable with the procedure.</em>

              <h3>How does it work?</h3>
              <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free™</i> works by using pulses of infrared diode laser energy to gradually heat the hair follicles in the subdermal
              layer of skin until they can no longer produce new hair. Using unique, IN-Motion™ technology and a patented DualChill™ treatment tip,
              the surface of your skin stays cool and comfortable. The sweeping motion also eliminates any skipped or missed spots common to other
              types of laser hair removal.
              </p>

              <p id="who">
              <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
              <b><i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free™</i> is for everyone.</b>
              It's safe for all skin types, hair types and most hair colors. It can even be used on tanned skin.
              The bottom line is – if you have hair where you wish you didn't, <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free</i> is for you.
              <br/>
              The treatment process is permanent, predictable, and virtually pain-free. You'll go through a series of visits to see the full benefits.
              </p>
              <p id="where">
              <h3>Where is it for?</h3>
              You can treatment almost any part of your body, including: <br/>
              • Legs <br/>
              • Arms <br/>
              • Bikini line <br/>
              • Back <br/>
              • Stomachs <br/>
              • Face, or <br/>
              • Neck <br/>
              </p>
              <p id="what">
              <h3>What can you expect?</h3>
              You can expect results from a series of relatively short sessions. (The actual time depends mainly on the size of the area you are
              having treated.) A trained doctor, nurse or laser technician performs each treatment and you are free to return to normal activities
              immediately after each session. <br/>
              <br/>
              <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free's</i> unique technology ensures treatment sessions can be virtually pain-free. Other benefits include: <br/>
              • Complete coverage with no missed spots <br/>
              • Fast treatment times <br/>
              • Few side effects <br/>
              • Return to normal activities immediately (no recovery or "down time") <br/>
              • Safe for all skin types, including tanned skin <br/>
              </p>

              </p>
              <p id="how_diff">
              <h3>How is it Different?</h3>
              <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free™</i> breaks the mold of previous laser hair removal systems. The system's unique IN-Motion™ technology, along with the sweeping
              motion of the laser, safely and gently heats the targeted area under your skin while you stay comfortable.
              </p>
              <p id="pain-free">
              <h3>What does Virtually Pain-Free mean?</h3>
              Most people find <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free™</i> very comfortable. While pain tolerance is subjective, many patients often
              describe the sensation as soothing as a "hot stone" massage.
              </p>
              <p id="treatments">
              <h3>How many treatments will I need?</h3>
              There are a number of factors that can affect the success of a series of hair removal treatments, but generally, after each treatment,
              you'll see a noticeable, permanent reduction in the number of hairs that re-grow in the treatment area. Typically, it will require
              4 - 6 treatments or more to permanently reduce the number of re-growing hairs by more than 80%, six months after the last treatment.
              </p>
              <p id="grow">
              <h3>Will my hair ever grow back?</h3>
              The short answer is no. Once the hair follicle is damaged, it cannot grow new hair. However, there are invariably a few hair follicles that manage
              to partially escape the laser during each treatment. Some of these follicles may be only stunned and will need to be retreated.
              </p>
              <p id="down">
              <h3>Do I need to plan for time off, for the treatments?</h3>
              No. <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free™</i> requires no "down time" or recovery time. You can have a treatment and return to work or school immediately.
              </p>

              <p id="cost">
              <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
              Pain-Free, Hair-Free treatment costs vary by location. Please schedule an appointment at our office and ask for a quotation.
              Compared with a lifetime of shaving, waxing or plucking, <i>Pain-Free, Hair-Free™</i> can be a worthwhile investment in both time and money-savings.
