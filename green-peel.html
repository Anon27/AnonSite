              <h3>A new skin in 5 days</h3>
              The natural, original GREEN PEEL® herbal peeling has been a worldwide success for more than 60 years. Two dermatologically-developed treatment methods are
              available for
              successful problem solving.
              </p>

              <p>More than 60 years ago, Christine Schrammek provided the foundation for the original GREEN PEEL® Herbal Peeling Treatment which helps people with various skin
                problems to get a clean and even skin. The basis is a mixture of eight selected herbs containing enzymes, minerals and vitamins, which are massaged into the skin.
                The Herbal Peeling Treatment was further medically developed and extended by her daughter, the dermatologist Dr. med. Christine Schrammek-Drusio, and is applied
                today by aestheticians and doctors worldwide. Varying amounts of the herbal plant mixtures allows the GREEN PEEL® Herbal Peeling Treatment to be adapted to
                individual skin conditions and the personal treatment goals.</p>

              <p>The original GREEN PEEL® Herbal Peeling Treatment is exclusively offered by certified aestheticians and doctors.</p>

              <h3>GREEN PEEL® Energy</h3>
              <h4>The Vitality and Regeneration kick without peeling effect</h4>
              This treatment with natural herbs noticeably provides energy. It stimulates blood circulation and metabolism and thus leads to a natural improvement of the skin
              texture without any peeling effect. GREEN PEEL® Energy provides your skin with the natural energy it needs to renew the cells. It helps to reduce age-related skin
              appearances as well as impurities, scarring and pigment disorders. The treatment visibly improves the skin’s appearance and harmonizes its surface. It works ideally
              as repeated, intensive salon treatment several times a year.
              </p>

              <p id="freshUp">
              <h3>GREEN PEEL® Fresh-Up</h3>
              <h4>The Freshness kick without peeling effect</h4>
              With this method, there is also no peeling effect. Instead, the skin is stimulated and refreshed with natural herbs. Blood circulation is stimulated, pores open and
              the skin is now able to optimally absorb the ingredients of the subsequent skin care. The complexion appears brighter and fresher. GREEN PEEL® Fresh-Up vitalizes the
              cells and your skin glows with a new freshness. This is why this treatment is the ideal problem solver for tired skin without freshness and serves as an effective
              prevention helper against premature aging and loss of elasticity - even if your skin hasn’t started showing the signs of age yet.
              </p>

              <p id="summer">
              <h3>Can a GREEN PEEL® treatment be performed during summertime?</h3>
              Yes. Our GREEN PEEL® Herbal Peeling treatment is performed in more than 50 countries, amongst others in South Africa where the sun is shining almost all year long. A
              GREEN PEEL® treatment can be done at any season. However, intensive sunbathing should initially be avoided after a GREEN PEEL® Classic treatment, as the rejuvenated,
              fresh skin is particularly sensitive to sunlight.
              </p>

              <p id="pain">
              <h3>Is a GREEN PEEL® treatment painful?</h3>
              There exist 2 methods of the GREEN PEEL® Herbal Peeling: Fresh up and Energy. During both methods our GREEN PEEL® Herbs are massaged into the skin.
              Depending on massage pressure and consistency of the skin, this can involve sparkling and prickling, but no pain. At the utmost the herbal massage can be slightly
              uncomfortable. The main difference between the methods are pressure and duration of massage. This can't be considered a wellness treatment, but it is well bearable.
              </p>

              <p id="aggresive">
              <h3>Is a GREEN PEEL® treatment aggressive?</h3>
              No. You can tell this by the fact that we - your skin therapist - don't need to wear special gloves during treatment. Our Herbal Peeling is purely natural and
              includes neither chemical substances nor abrasive particles.
              </p>

              <p id="compare">
              <h3>What's the difference between GREEN PEEL® and Chemical Peeling or micro needling?</h3>
              Our Original GREEN PEEL® Herbal Peeling is based on a medically refined and worldwide proven biological method, on a pure natural basis. It is safe and can be used
              with almost any skin type. GREEN PEEL® does not need machines and successfully solves various of skin problems.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The fruit acid peeling however is a chemical peeling, which is based on milk-, lemon-, apple- or wine-acid. A fruit acid peeling is preferable done in low-sunlight
              months, as during the summer months there has to be paid a lot of attention to sun exposure. This kind of peeling requires 8-10 sessions in weekly intervals before
              showing visible results.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Micro needling is a relatively new instrument for treating aesthetic skin problems. Here the skin is injured with numerous small needles to stimulate its
              self-regeneration. Additionally active ingredients are transfected into the skin. Some skin problems, such as scars, wrinkles, stretch marks can be improved by micro
              needling.
              </p>

              <p id="sensitive">
              <h3>Does a GREEN PEEL® treatment cause my skin to be thinner and more sensitive?</h3>
              No. After a GREEN PEEL® treatment the skin is young and fresh. Of course this skin needs special attention. With every GREEN PEEL® your skin becomes stronger, firmer
              and resistant. Metabolism is activated, microcirculation as well as the interlocking of skin layers is improved. This in turn results in the skin receiving more
              oxygen and nutrients. The connective tissue fibers (collagenous and elastic fibers) are activated and metabolic wastes wicked away.
              </p>

              <p id="choose">
              <h3>Which one is the right treatment for me?</h3>
              GREEN PEEL® Fresh Up (without skin peeling) is suitable for: pigmentation disorders, tired, pale skin und for general dissatisfaction with skin condition.
              GREEN PEEL® Energy (without skin peeling) is suitable for: age related skin conditions, impurities, pale skin, scars and pigmentation disorders.
